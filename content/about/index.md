## Who am I?

I am from Chaling County, Zhuzhou City, Hunan, China. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Communication Engineering at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My research primarily focuses on pivotal topics like AI job scheduling in the 6G endogenous intelligent network environment.

## My Experience

From 2014 to 2018, I attended Hunan Xiangtan University, where I pursued my undergraduate degree in network engineering.

In the following year, between 2018 and 2019, I had the opportunity to work as a developer in the philatelic department of Hunan Changsha Xiangyou Technology Co., Ltd.

Starting from 2020, I commenced my journey towards a master's degree at the prestigious Southern University of Science and Technology. This program is expected to last until 2023, allowing me to delve deeper into my chosen field of study.

Currently, I am dedicated to pursuing my Ph.D. at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, starting from 2023 and continuing until the present. During this research-intensive period, I aim to expand my knowledge and contribute to the advancement of my field.
